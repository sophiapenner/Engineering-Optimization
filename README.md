# Mech450D-Engineering-Optimization
The task of finding an optimal solution to an engineering problem can often be cast in the form of finding a point, at which the objective function reaches its minimum (or, alternatively, maximum) value. The fundamental objective of this course is to introduce some core concepts in optimization theory along with its relevant numerical techniques. Topics covered: linear and nonlinear optimization methods, algorithms for constrained and unconstrained problems, and global optimization methods such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).
